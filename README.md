## What is Sergal bot?

SergalBot is a discord bot that exists primarily to publicly release my side projects in a presentable manner to the public. I intend to expand and update the bot based on my needs, however as time goes on it may have features that I want others to experience.

_It is meant to be:_
- easy to expand
- easy to run
- fun to use
  
and is based on this quote:
> "Is this too much voodoo for our mission statement?" - Legendary Programmer

*It really does help when writing code*

## Features
- Uses MySQL + MySQL Interface to make it easy! (Sqlite for those who need it)
- Automatic Database Updater
- Permissions Management ( :x: coming soon)
- Pathfinders DM Helper ( :x: coming soon)
- Reminders/Notifications ( :x: coming soon)

*Features may be added or removed*

## Try for yourself
### Local install
*guide coming soon...*
### Sergal hosted
Currently, as the bot is not in a working state, I do not have a link to my discord bot. More in the future.
